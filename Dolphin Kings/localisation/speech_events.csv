EVTDESCroyspeech.1;Your speech was a rousing success! Many people from all corners of your realm gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Assembly Chamber to hear you speak of your undying devotion to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. The masses were impressed by your prayers, some even fainting in the stands. Soon, word of this event will spread across the entire realm!;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.1;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] be praised!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.2;Your speech did not go as planned. Barely anyone showed up, and the guests that did arrive were unattentive during your speech, even laughing and talking over you.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.2;I'm so embarrassed!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.3;Your Military Parade was a success! You started the day with a Parade March that proceeded all around [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. Then, you addressed the troops in formation before handing out golden rewards at a pre-planned ceremony. Your commanders and the peasantry alike greatly admired the spectacle and there is now no shortage of men willing to serve the crown.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.3;To Victory!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.4;You managed to botch the Military Parade spectacularly. Nearly every event was behind schedule, men deserted, believing they were on their way to fight, and some even turned up to the Assembly Chamber drunk and causing havoc. In the end, the event had to be cancelled prematurely.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.4;This is all my fault...;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.5;Your speech was a success! You were able to clearly and reasonably define your expectations from your vassals and people. Most, you feel, are on the same page as you while many more could not deny your oratory skill.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.5;United We Stand!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.6;Your speech on realm policy was a failure. The day was plagued by bad weather, causing great complaint from your vassals. When it was time for you to speak, many showed little interest, few even left early. The peasants seem to have taken your message in an unexpectedly odd way.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.6;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;x
