EVTOPTB_SNW_29122;It was a bad investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2913;While you are making some small purchases, Holo barges into the discussion and asks if she can try to haggle over the price of some of the items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2913;Let her try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2913;Mind your own business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2914;While you walking around the market, you see some religious men preaching to a group of people. One of them waves his hand to bid you to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2914;Say a small prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2914;Go and spend some time with the group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2914;Roll your eyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2914;Ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2915;You were browsing in a unfamiliar market and have strayed from the main road with Holo. Feeling rather lost, you noticed some shepherds and decided to go and to talk to them, alone, to ask for directions.\nAs you are walking back to where you left Holo, you can see that she looks fairly irritated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2915;... What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2915;I will buy her some mutton.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2915;Admit that you got lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2915;Ignore her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2916;It seems that humility is not one of Holo's virtues. She rarely misses an opportunity to show her intelligence and wits. She also tends to compare her hair to the most delicate silk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2916;Brag about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2916;Say that her hair smells like a wet dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2916;Theatrically bow to her greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2916;Ignore her bragging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2917;Crowded markets mean that small thieves pass unnoticed easily. Which just happened to us right now. Luckily, your guards spotted the child before he stole something from your cart and pursued him down to an alley.\nSomehow, Holo found him first. He looks scared and malnourished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2917;Bring the kid to the city guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2917;Give the child some coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2917;Give Holo some coins and tell her to take care of the kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2917;Ignore the kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2918;You were walking around the market with Holo when you overheard merchants talking about how the wolves in the surrounding area have become more daring lately, attacking their men on the roads and killing animals in many farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2918;Hire some hunters to take care of the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2918;Have some people put warning signs about the wolves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2918;These dogs are no threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_2919;You see some musical instruments being sold at a stall nearby.\nHolo wastes no time teasing you, saying that she is sure that you cannot play any of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2919;Buy some musical instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2919;Buy and play some musical instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2919;Buy and sell the instruments immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2919;Don't buy anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2920;Holo often talks about her hair, complimenting its luster and softness. You assure her that you can find fabrics that can rival it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2920;Compare it to this piece of velvet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2920;Compare it to this piece of linen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2920;Compare it to this piece of wool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2920;Ignore her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2921;While you are browsing through some trinkets, the merchant in front of you has spent some time starring at Holo. Just as you were going to leave, he tells you that such a charming companion deserves the best goods he have and offers you a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2921;Buy the baubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2921;Buy the baubles and donate them to a temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2921;Pass the opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guilds_charming_discount;Charming influence:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2922;You both arrive in front of a fairly colored stand and its owner starts talking about his wares. You explain to Holo that, despite the vibrant colors, these dyes are not meant for eating.\n\nShe looks a bit insulted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2922;Buy some dye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2922;Buy her something to eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SNW_2922;Move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2923;You arrive at a sculptor's workshop with Holo. The craftsman can make most kinds of statues and Holo jokingly requests one as large as possible, big enough to dwarf her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2923;Mock her with a small one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_2923;Request a religious sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SNW_2923;Order a large statue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_29107;Holo is §Runhappy§! about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SNW_293;Holo the Wise Wolf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_293;You have known Holo for quite some time now. Her weird antics, mixed with her prideful attitude, brought some fresh air to your usual business trips.\n\nToday was no different, as she accompanied you on your travels, but after that she requested that you meet her in private in the field you first met. She is not usually shy about interacting with your retainers, but you agreed to her request nonetheless. The night is not unlike that of your first encounter and she is waiting for you in the middle of the wheat crops.\n\n"It is time I show thy who I really am...", she said while pulling her hood down, revealing wolf ears and what seem to be a tail waving under her robe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_293;This explains a few things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_293;Burn the witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2932;Holo appears relieved that your reaction was not hostile, flashing you a bright smile and presenting her pronounced fangs. Her loneliness was weighing heavily on her and finding a friend and confident in you is something she is really grateful.\n\n"'Tis is a good moon, have you no wine?" she asks, still smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2932;I must have some in the cart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guilds_holo_councillor;She can now be appointed to some councilor positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2934;You hail to your retainers to bring torches and weapons. This demon has been planning something for a long time and you will not let it get its way.\nYou organize a massive hunt to track it down, to no avail. It has vanished without as much as a trace, proving her culpability and wickedness.\n\nA few days later, a man brings you a lock of hair found on a tree branch, claiming it was hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2934;This will serve as a reminder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SNW_294;Holo's longing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_294_A;As time passes, your once spirited companion seems more melancholic and conflicted. She is not playing around as much as she used to, nor is she giving as many clever speeches. Your friendship seems to have reached its peak and could turn into staleness.\n\nShe often speaks of her distant hometown and her wish to return before your friendship loses any more of its luster, preferring to keep the good memories she made with you rather than replacing them with ones of monotony.\n\nWhile it is not sure when it will be, she will leave eventually. You have known her for a long time now, perhaps you could rekindle the fire between the two of you and get her to stay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

She has looked rather preoccupied lately.\n\n On your way to check your cart you notice something particular on your seat. It is the charm that Holo used to carry all the time. She finally answered the call of her home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2942_B;When you woke up this morning you had the impression that something was missing and the feeling kept getting bigger as the day went on. It was only after noticing something on your bedchamber's cupboard that you understood.

Her anchor gone, she finally answered the call of her home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_2942;She will be missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_2952;It has been a few days since Holo's disappearance and things have calmed now. You receive from time to time reports about a massive wolf running in the fields or eating sheeps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_311;Let me give you a piece of advice, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName], free of charge.\nI see that you have yet to find an Apprentice.

EVTDESC_SNW_321;Greetings, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nI can't help but notice that you have no proper storage for your trade goods. I would recommend renting or building one, for we all know how full of thieves and brigands the streets are.\nI know an architect that can find or build one, you only need to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_322;We have several options to start with. We can rent a building to store our goods, which would be simple and cheap. But we wouldn't own or know the building. On the other hand, we can build it from the ground. If we have the proper goods it could even be fairly cheap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We will fight back and take over the entire economy of the known world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_382_OUTSIDER;The blatant tax evasion of these brigands knowns no bounds. Ever since these peasants banded together to rob us of our rightful earnings, they have grown bolder every day.\n\nAll feudal lords have agreed to an alliance, in order to take control of our economy once again.

EVTDESC_SNW_421;Greetings, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName].\nWe have noticed a slowdown in the international trade. Such a decline could be problematic for the future of the Great Trade League, as we rely on trading on a very large area to gain the most favorable prices. Thus, we are asking members such as you to send caravans to stimulate the economy of various nations.\nSigned,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_421_apprentice;Master [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nWe have received news that the Great Trade League is concerned that our nation may be turning towards more isolationist policies. We could easily soothe their fears by simply sending a caravan to a foreign realm. Also, the extra profits would be welcome.\n\nYour apprentice, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_424;Salutation [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWe are pleased to see that you participated in some extra realm trading. Sending caravans over long distances may be hazardous, as bandits and wars are ever present, but the potential economic stimulus should not be underestimated.\n\nI hope to see one of your caravans at my gates in the near future,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_424;Then I'll be expecting one from you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_427;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt is unfortunate what happened to these good men and women you sent with the caravan, but these are the risks of the trade. The Great Trade League will compensate you for the losses. But do not let such a small failure to scare you from doing further businesses.\n\nI wish you better luck for your next caravan,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_427;It wouldn't be profitable if it was too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_430;A messenger came to your court with a strange message.\nIt appears that your vassal, [From.GetFirstName], has renounced to feudalism and embraced republicanism. How absurd!\nWhat would be the best answer to this traitor who bastardized your realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_431;To the traitorous [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nYour attachment to the ways of this Great Trade League has gone too far! I hereby declare you a traitor to the realm. Justice will come for you, and I am justice here.\n\nYour liege,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_431;[From.GetSheHeCap] won't dare arrest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_432;To the fool [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nWhile I believe that you hold the Great Trade League creed in too high regard, I would never think of interfering with your decision. However, this cannot be said of all of my vassals, if you know what I mean.\n\nYour liege,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_432;[From.GetSheHeCap] think [From.GetSheHe] is so clever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_433;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI cannot help but notice that you seem to have transformed your territory into a republic. I fail to see how this would benefit me and the realm as a whole. Perhaps you and your patricians could convince me?\n\nYour liege,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SNW_434;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI cannot in good conscience do something as underhanded as a bribe! The advantages of a republic over your obsolete system are as clear as diamonds. The only argument I have for you is the wind out of my behind.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SNW_434;Then this traitor will get what's coming to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SNW_434;Then some of my vassals will restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SNW_435;Greetings [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI understand your concerns and know the perfect way to soothe them. Me and my fellow patricians have gathered these coins as sign of our goodwill and our desire for a profitable partnership between vassal and liege.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
