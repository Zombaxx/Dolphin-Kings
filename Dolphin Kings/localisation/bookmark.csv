BM_WP;Dolphin Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WP_INFO;Long ago, humanity vanished off the face of the Earth. Millennia later the Dolphins of the Seven Seas have progressed into tribal and feudal civilizations, entering their own Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of dolphin-kind and the disaster that destroyed humanity. Knowledge of the humans has faded into myths and legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_103475;Duke Dolphinius the Ichthysist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_103475;Sitting at the strategic chokepoint of the English Channel, with Narwiphysite practitioners under an Ichthysist liege, the aquatic domain of the vassal Duke Dolphinius presents itself as an important outpost of the Kingdom of the Bay of Biscay against both schismed blasphemers that abandoned the authority of His Holyness, and the Dolphinic tribal savages practicing the barbaric Old Ways of the Beforetimes. To the south, at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, the remnants of the Dulphi Caliphate block access to fellow Ichthysist realms and seek to reunite their lost lands as a new era of Holy Wars begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_113325;Seaworlders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_113325;Once an early beacon of feudal Dolphin innovation within a sea of otherwise scattered tribal lands, the descendants of Seaworld, following the Airist pagan beliefs of their forebearers of spending time in the Sun to receive blessings in special ceremonies, survive in a fractured state as the Ichthysists from the south and the nomads from the north encroach into their territories. Will the Kingdom of Sea World be restored, or will the once mighty culture be reduced to vassals, exiles, and refuges?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_104565;Aegean Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_104565;The Piscesenic birthplace of the Aegean Sea clings to its ancient pagan beliefs as the adjacent regions of the protected Mediterranean Sea remain diverse with multiple competing Dolphianic religions despite constant conquests back and forth. A greater Piscesenic kingdom lies deeper within the Atlantic Ocean that could be of political use if they could ever manage to get past the Dulphi Caliphate and Ichthysist realms in between. They believe that Pisces is the leader of the Zodiac and daughter of the ruling god, and that through their rituals they will unlock a greater philosophical understanding of dolphinkind and restore the once mighty Piscenic empire of Aquaexander the Eminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_113385;Koiism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_113385;The Empire of the South China Sea remains nearly as old as recorded history itself, united under the first Fishist dynasty after the Battlelord Era. With the days of the fourth dynasty’s reign seemingly in decline after a conversion to Ichthysism causes internal turmoil among the nobility, will the Empire stand the test of time or shatter into the same chaos as the rest of the seas as the loyalty of the new Koiist Duke comes into question?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_100165;Way of the Shark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_100165;The dolphins of the Sharktec pagan traditions follow their namesake’s philosophy, abandoning both the Old Ways of the first dolphins from prior eons and the more recent monotheistic Dolphianic traditions from the past millennium. Although scattered across the Caribbean and Atlantic, their kingdoms are easily consolidated and a substantial threat to their neighbors. Their Shamans believe that ritual sacrifice allows their armies the strength of the Sacred Sharks and a rejection of the weakness of Dolphianic philosophies, driving fear into the hearts of all that oppose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
