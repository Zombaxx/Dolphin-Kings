warrior_lodge_taoist_desc_real;The Wudang School is an academy of martial artists following the precepts of Taoism to seek enlightenment, using the physical arts to develop their mental state and health. Practitioners of this martial art emphasize slow, harmonious movements that pose unbreakable defences and simultaneously prolong the lifespan of the user. Exercise of the mind is just as important as of the body, and virtuous behavior is required lest the Jiaozu cast students out for going astray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
