### At the moment we have a pretty basic icon system for combat tactics showing
### the uniticon which has the biggest bonus value in the tactic.
### This is the sprite number for each unit:
### Good 	 1=LI	 2=HI	 3=PIKE	 4=LC	 5=KNIGHTS	 6=ARCHERS	 7=HORSE ARCH.	 8=GALLEY	 9=ELEPHANT	10=CAMEL
### Neutral 11=LI	12=HI	13=PIKE	14=LC	15=KNIGHTS	16=ARCHERS	17=HORSE ARCH.	18=GALLEY	19=ELEPHANT	20=CAMEL
### Bad 	21=LI	22=HI	23=PIKE	24=LC	25=KNIGHTS	26=ARCHERS	27=HORSE ARCH.	28=GALLEY	29=ELEPHANT	30=CAMEL
